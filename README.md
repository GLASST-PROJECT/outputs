# Travel behaviour synthetic survey generation

This repository https://github.com/Public-Health-Modelling-Cambridge/travelBehaviour contains code for the generative approach to create synthetic travel surveys for cities worldwide, addressing gaps in traditional travel survey data. The method uses econometric models and machine learning, trained on a dataset of 28 cities, with Bogot√° as a test case. Key outputs include weekly trip rates, travel times, mode shares, and trip distributions by age and gender, showing strong alignment with observed data. The approach is adaptable for further validation in other study areas.
